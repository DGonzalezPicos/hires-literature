4,2209.02875,high-resolution spectral models of trappist-1e seen as a pale blue dot   for elt and jwst observations,astro-ph.ep,"rocky exoplanets orbiting in the habitable zone (hz) of nearby m dwarfs provide unique opportunities for characterizing their atmospheres and searching for biosignature gases. trappist-1e, a temperate earth-sized exoplanet in the hz of a nearby m dwarf, is arguably the most favorable target for ground- and space-based atmospheric characterization by the extremely large telescopes (elts) and the james webb space telescope (jwst). to inform future observations in reflected and emitted lights using these upcoming telescopes, we simulate the high-resolution reflection and emission spectra for trappist-1e for both modern and prebiotic earth-like atmospheric compositions. to demonstrate the effects of wavelength-dependent albedo on climate and spectra, we further simulate five albedo scenarios for each atmospheric composition: cloudy modern earth-like, cloud-free modern earth-like, cloudy ocean planet, 100 per cent cloudy planet, and wavelength-independent albedo of 0.31. we use the recent mega-muscles spectral energy distribution (sed) of trappist-1 for our models. we show that the o$_2$ + ch$_4$ and o$_3$ + ch$_4$ biosignature pairs as well as climate indicators (co$_2$ and h$_2$o) show features in both high-resolution reflection and emission spectra of trappist-1e that the elts can search for. our high-resolution database for modern and prebiotic earth trappist-1e models with various surface compositions and cloud distributions provides a tool for observers to train retrieval algorithms and plan observation strategies to characterize this potentially habitable world.",10.1093/mnras/stac2536,2022-09-06,,"['zifan lin', 'lisa kaltenegger']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02875,True
8,2209.03669,the study of atmosphere of hot jupiters and their host stars,astro-ph.ep astro-ph.im astro-ph.sr,"what makes the study of exoplanetary atmospheres so hard is the extraction of its tiny signal from observations, usually dominated by telluric absorption, stellar spectrum and instrumental noise. the high resolution spectroscopy has emerged as one of the leading techniques for detecting atomic and molecular species (birkby 2018), but although it is particularly robust against contaminant absorption in the earth's atmosphere, the non-stationary stellar spectrum -- in the form of either doppler shift or distortion of the line profile during planetary transits -- creates a non-negligible source of noise that can alter or even prevent the detection. recently, significant improvements have been achieved by using 3d, radiative hydrodynamical (rhd) simulations for the star and global circulation models (gcm) for the planet (e.g., chiavassa & brogi 2019, flowers et al. 2019). however, these numerical simulations have been computed independently so far, while acquired spectra are the result of the natural coupling at each phase along the planet orbit. with our work, we aim at generating emission spectra of g,f, and k-type stars and hot jupiters and coupling them at any phase of the orbit. this approach is expected to be particularly advantageous for those molecules that are present in both the atmospheres (e.g., co) and form in the same region of the spectrum, resulting in mixed and overlapped spectral lines. we also present the analysis of transmission spectra of the hot saturn wasp-20b, observed in the k-band of the recently upgraded spectrograph crires+ at a resolution ~92, 000 during the first night of the science verification of the instrument and that led to a tentative detection of h2o.",,2022-09-08,,"['maria chiara maimone', 'andrea chiavassa', 'jeremy leconte', 'matteo brogi']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03669,True
